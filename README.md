# Progressively enhanced `<select>`

A small PoC to test out how custom elements could be used to build a custom
`<select>` component that would provide modern features (e.g. icons, filtering
options, etc).

The goal is for this to be:

- small and lightweight
- still work without Javascript

See [/index.html](./index.html) for usage of `<my-select>`.

Demo available. Execute:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

And visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
